I am an [artist][0], a writer, an entrepreneur and a Network Marketer --- a perfect imbalance of creativity, passion and innovation. I'm also a wife, and mother to 2 precious girls {7 and 5} ... as well as a daughter, and baby sister to 2 OLDER sisters. For more than a decade, I've been struggling with an identity crisis. It took dying {only briefly} and 5+ years to get here, but I'm finally discovering my true self --- mind, body, soul and spirit. Mine is a life transformed. This is my story. And my purpose.[][0]

Perhaps a little neurot, but I'm a great leader! I love guiding others to reach their potential. It pushes me to reach mine. 

I believe in allowing people to be exactly who they were created to be.

Fullness of Spirit is what I strive for. My perspective has changed quite a bit since that day that I died ... but then LIVED!!

Quirky? Yes, I have my quirks!! I've learned to appreciate them ... Living the life of a post-perfectionist, I've concluded that I am perfect --- perfectly flawed, perfectly off-balanced, perfectly made imperfect. I'm now living a messy life ... redefined. I fail more often than not, but I'm grateful for the chance to begin again each day. And maybe I'll create something amazing along the way.
